- Remove / update unneeded classes
  - RARunningAppsProvider
- Fix IntroTutorial

Bugs:
- Showing NC with reachapp doesnt properly resize (not even sure if possible)
- Empoleon windows dont properly rotate in some (most) apps
- RA broken on 9.0.2?
- Fix UIWindow crash
  - See method

Minor Things/Bugs to note:
- Optimize FakePhoneMode (use Classic Modes)
- Keyboard Dismisses reachability (apparently a feature?)
- FF broken with camera app (Out of aura's scope. Because of AppDelegate)
- Really need to clean headers
- Clean up code
  - Use generics?
  - Fix tabs??

Things to do/Features to add:
- 3D Touch actions?
- Unify StatusBar in SO side by side
- Make Modules more independent

notes:
use _referenceBounds instead of bounds on UIScreen to get physical bounds. Makes landscape support easier?
(_referenceBounds orientation independent, bounds changes with orientation)

SBSystemGestureManager replaces SBHandMotionExtractor on 9+
Somehow find a way to convert existing system to hook/use it?
