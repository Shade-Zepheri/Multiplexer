update status:

Windowed: working
fs daemon: working
SwipeOver: working (replace with native slide over(?))
Reachability: working (show NC broken in 10.x)
GestureSupport: fixed
Backgrounding: working
KeyboardSupport: hackily fixed but it works now
MissionControl: working
NCApp: working (not tested on ipad);
assertiond hooks: working
backboardd hooks: unknown
fake phone mode: working


- adding items to SBAppSwitcherModel is broken
- SwipeOver sliding off screen animation is broken (RASwipeOverManager.xm:L62)
- icons and apps do not show up in RASnapshotProvider
- GestureSupport: LandscapeLeft is, once again, broken

Bugs:
- Individual app force foregrounding is broken when used in conjunction with auto (re)launch;
- Invoking keyboard in reachapp closes view (I think reachability dismisses when using KB)
- Showing NC with reachapp doesnt properly resize (not even sure if possible)
- Foregrounding through activator broken (override gets removed when launching another app)
- CC inhibitor not reliable on 9.x+?

Minor Things/Bugs to note:
- MC view invokes regardless if grabbing the grabber or not (was always like that?)
- MC works but causes jittery animations;
- NCApp disappears on first load (see last issue)
- Some say it causes serious lag (probably because logs werent disabled)?
- Startup bug still isnt fixed (apparently caused by gesture support?)
- General Code Cleanup, feels to messy RN
- Calling launchapplication:suspended in host manager fixes issues with multiple windows but causes ReachApp and NCApp to not properly load apps when they are suspended
  (doesnt seem to be an issue anymore)

Features to Add:
- 3D Touch actions?

notes:
use _referenceBounds instead of bounds on UIScreen to get physical bounds. Makes landscape support easier?
