- adding items to SBAppSwitcherModel is broken
- SwipeOver sliding off screen animation is broken (RASwipeOverManager.xm:L62)
- icons and apps do not show up in RASnapshotProvider
- GestureSupport: LandscapeLeft is, once again, broken

Bugs:
- Individual app force foregrounding is broken when used in conjunction with auto (re)launch;
- MC view invokes regardless if grabbing the grabber or not
- Replace AppSwitcher with MC is broken
- Invoking keyboard in reachapp closes view


notes:
use _referenceBounds instead of bounds on UIScreen to get physical bounds. Makes landscape support easier?
