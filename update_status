iOS 11: (Oh boy)
- Fix / rework IntroTutorial
- Remove / update unneeded classes
  - RASBWorkspaceFetcher
  - RAAppSwitcherModelWrapper
  - RASnapshotProvider
- iX and Gestures (just figure that out)
- Extensions
  - Verify everything works

Aura: (Own mini section cuz needs a ton of work)
- Rework IconIndicator
  - Re-add ColorBadges stuffs
  - Rework badge info system
- SpringBoard.x (just relook over the whole thing);
- Aura breaks calls? (kill on exit / Needs testing)
- Individual app force foregrounding is broken when used in conjunction with auto (re)launch
- Prevent Death doesnt protect from system killing
- SI messes with Apple Watch

Updates:
- Improve stability
- Maybe separate hooks from main framework
- Update Public API (that nobody uses)
- Separate widgets from core to ReachApp

Bugs:
- Showing NC with reachapp doesnt properly resize (not even sure if possible)
- Fix weird animations when going HS
- Empoleon windows dont properly rotate in some (most) apps
- RA broken on 9.0.2?
- Fix UIWindow crash
  - See method

Minor Things/Bugs to note:
- Really need to rewrite ReachApp
- Optimize FakePhoneMode (use Classic Modes)
- FF broken with camera app (Out of aura's scope. Because of AppDelegate)
- Really need to clean headers
- Clean up code
  - Use generics?
  - Atom messed up my tabs so gotta fix that

Things to do/Features to add:
- 3D Touch actions?
- Unify StatusBar in SO side by side
- Make Modules more independent
- (New one) add protection from Rogue apps?

notes:
use _referenceBounds instead of bounds on UIScreen to get physical bounds. Makes landscape support easier?
(_referenceBounds orientation independent, bounds changes with orientation)

SBSystemGestureManager replaces SBHandMotionExtractor on 9+
Somehow find a way to convert existing system to hook/use it?
