update status:

Windowed: working
fs daemon: working
SwipeOver: working (replace with native slide over(nope, SwipeOver is something Special))
Reachability: working (show NC broken in 10.x)
GestureSupport: fixed
Backgrounding: working
KeyboardSupport: semi-working
MissionControl: working
NCApp: working
assertiond hooks: working
backboardd hooks: working
fake phone mode: working (hacky tho)

Bugs:
- Fix Aura ForceForegrounding
- Showing NC with reachapp doesnt properly resize (not even sure if possible)
- Aura breaks calls? (kill on exit)
- Empoleon windows dont properly rotate in some (most) apps

Minor Things/Bugs to note:
- Optimize FakePhoneMode (use Classic Modes)
- Keyboard Dismisses reachability (apparently a feature?)

Things to do/Features to add:
- 3D Touch actions?
- Unify StatusBar in SO side by side

notes:
use _referenceBounds instead of bounds on UIScreen to get physical bounds. Makes landscape support easier?
(_referenceBounds orientation independent, bounds changes with orientation)

SBSystemGestureManager replaces SBHandMotionExtractor on 9+
Somehow find a way to convert existing system to hook/use it?
