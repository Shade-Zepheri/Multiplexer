update status:

Windowed: working
fs daemon: working
SwipeOver: working (replace with native slide over(?))
Reachability: working (show NC broken in 10.x)
GestureSupport: fixed
Backgrounding: working
KeyboardSupport: semi-working
MissionControl: working
NCApp: working (misaligned on ipads);
assertiond hooks: working
backboardd hooks: working
fake phone mode: semi working

Bugs:
- Fix KeyboardSupport
- Individual app force foregrounding is broken when used in conjunction with auto (re)launch (cant seeem to reproduce anymore);
- Showing NC with reachapp doesnt properly resize (not even sure if possible)
- SwipeOver sliding on screen animation is broken
- SwipeOver grabber doesnt always show when supposed to
- Aura breaks calls? (kill on exit)
- Apps crashes due to hook of _sendTouchesForEvent in UIWindow
- NCApp app still doesnt properly unload (more testing required)
- FakePhoneMode wrong dimensions
- Empoleon windows dont properly rotate in some apps

Minor Things/Bugs to note:
- Seems split caused more blackscreens in windowed apps
- (some of these are leftover from the original release lol: eg MC lag)
- Improve SwipeOver

Things to do/Features to add:
- 3D Touch actions?
- General Code Cleanup/conform to standards, feels to messy RN (at least indents are fine)

notes:
use _referenceBounds instead of bounds on UIScreen to get physical bounds. Makes landscape support easier?
(_referenceBounds orientation independent, bounds changes with orientation)

SBSystemGestureManager replaces SBHandMotionExtractor on 9+
Somehow find a way to convert existing system to hook it?
