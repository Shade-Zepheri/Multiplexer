update status:

Windowed: working
fs daemon: working
SwipeOver: working (replace with native slide over(?))
Reachability: working (show NC broken in 10.x)
GestureSupport: fixed
Backgrounding: working
KeyboardSupport: hackily fixed but it works now
MissionControl: working
NCApp: working (not tested on ipad);
assertiond hooks: working
backboardd hooks: unknown
fake phone mode: working


- adding items to SBAppSwitcherModel is broken
- SwipeOver sliding off screen animation is broken (RASwipeOverManager.xm:L62)
- icons and apps do not show up in RASnapshotProvider
- GestureSupport: LandscapeLeft is, once again, broken

Bugs:
- Individual app force foregrounding is broken when used in conjunction with auto (re)launch;
- Invoking keyboard in reachapp closes view (I think reachability dismisses when using KB)
- Showing NC with reachapp doesnt properly resize (not even sure if possible)
- Launching MC from activator gesture in app black screen
- Foregrounding through activator broken (override gets removed when launching another app)
- CC inhibitor still broken?

Minor Things/Bugs to note:
- RA favorites layout messed up
- MC view invokes regardless if grabbing the grabber or not (was always like that?)
- MC works but causes jittery animations;
- NCApp disappears on first load
- Some say it causes serious lag (probably because logs werent disabled)?
- Startup bug still isnt fixed (find cause / better fix)
- General Code Cleanup, feels to messy RN

notes:
use _referenceBounds instead of bounds on UIScreen to get physical bounds. Makes landscape support easier?
