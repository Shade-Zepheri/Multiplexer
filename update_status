update status:

Windowed: working
fs daemon: working
SwipeOver: working (replace with native slide over(nope, SwipeOver is something Special))
Reachability: working (show NC broken in 10.x)
GestureSupport: fixed
Backgrounding: working
KeyboardSupport: semi-working
MissionControl: working
NCApp: working
assertiond hooks: working
backboardd hooks: working
fake phone mode: semi working

Bugs:
- Fix KeyboardSupport
- Individual app force foregrounding is broken when used in conjunction with auto (re)launch (cant seeem to reproduce anymore);
- Showing NC with reachapp doesnt properly resize (not even sure if possible)
- Aura breaks calls? (kill on exit)
- Apps crashes due to hook of _sendTouchesForEvent in UIWindow
- FakePhoneMode wrong dimensions
- Empoleon windows dont properly rotate in some (most) apps
- MC gives black screen when in apps

Minor Things/Bugs to note:
- (some of these are leftover from the original release lol: eg MC lag)
- SwipeOver grabber doesnt always show when supposed to (eg on SpringBoard, which nothing seems to work)
- Something is running in the background and increasing background usage (Thought it was NCApp but more testing required)

Things to do/Features to add:
- 3D Touch actions?

notes:
use _referenceBounds instead of bounds on UIScreen to get physical bounds. Makes landscape support easier?
(_referenceBounds orientation independent, bounds changes with orientation)

SBSystemGestureManager replaces SBHandMotionExtractor on 9+
Somehow find a way to convert existing system to hook/use it?
